This dataset, taken from a [Kaggle dataset repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer), consists of 11 european countries and their respective championships or leagues. There are 25,000 matches plus in the dataset and more than 10,000 players. But for our analysis, we will concentrate on just the top four leagues in Europe: The Premiership in England, the Bundesliga in Germany, La liga in Spain, and Series A in Italy. 

## Introduction

The dataset contains information about 11 european top football leagues as well as players. There are 25,000 matches in the dataset. To get a sense of the exploratory activity carried out and the insights derived, see the file ` notebook.ipynb `. 

## Data Wrangling and Cleaning

Data wrangling activities involved looking for datatype inconsistencies, missing values, duplicated rows, and the data dimension. Data cleaning was mostly on converting date features to datetime objects. Some of the missing values were ignored due to the uniqueness of the attributes of teams and players. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA answered five questions, namely:

1. What teams won the most games?

2. Is A Player's Preferred Foot Determinant Of Effectiveness?

3. Who Are The Best European Penalty Takers?

4. Which Team Creates More Chances And Which Has The Best Defensive Setup?

5. Who Are The Best Overall Players?

All these questions were explored for the 2008-2016 seasons cumulatively. 

## Conclusions

The conclusion raised some questions about European soccer and also outlined the limitations I faced while exploring the datasets. You can find them on the ` notebook.ipynb ` file.
